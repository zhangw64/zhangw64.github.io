This is a machine learning classification project worked by me, Maggie(Jingyi) Li, and Levent Kayin from the Emory MSBA program Machine Learning class.

The goal is to predict whether a mobile ad will be clicked. The dataset is from a competition on Kaggle :

Code 1 is to sample the original training dataset to a smaller random sample for model building.

Code 2 is the main bulk of code to build models and make predictions.
