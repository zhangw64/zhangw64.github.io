I am pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics degree at Emory University Goizueta Business School. Prior to this, I have interned at Accenture consulting, Microsoft Azure cloud sales, and a venture capital firm. I am well equipped with analytical skills and tools such as SQL, machine learning, data visualization (Tableau, Power BI, ggplot2), big data tools (Hadoop, Spark, AWS), and data mining (R, Python, Rapidminer). 
I graduated from the University of Michigan with a double-major degree in Economics and PPE (Philosophy, Politics, and Economics), where I have also been the co-founder and president of a student theatre club. My liberal arts background and internship experiences have guided me to become an effective communicator and critical thinker with an understanding of business contexts.
